## 2026-07-24
- **Files changed:**
  - `frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/timetable/page.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/materials/MaterialCard.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/materials/materials.module.css`
  - `frontend/src/types/api.types.ts`
  - `backend/pom.xml`
- **Reason:** Full QA audit + fix all identified bugs.
- **Summary:**
  - BUG-004 Fixed: Dashboard was showing hardcoded fake stats (14.5 hrs, 24 tasks, 3 exams) and fake Focus Areas. Replaced with real API hooks: `useExams()`, `usePriority()`, `timetableApi.getActive()`.
  - BUG-006 Fixed: Timetable slot update errors now trigger `toast.error()` instead of being swallowed silently.
  - MaterialCard upgraded: Now shows AI summary (expandable) and AI-categorized subject badge powered by Groq async analysis. Shows "AI analyzing..." badge while pending.
  - `StudyMaterial` type updated to include `aiSummary`, `aiCategorizedSubject`, `fileName`, `fileSizeBytes`, `materialType`.
  - `spring-security-test` added to pom.xml: Unblocks `MaterialControllerTest` which was blocked due to missing dependency.
  - Notification settings: Added "backend sync coming soon" note in Settings UI.
- **Impact:** Dashboard now shows only real user data. Materials page now surfaces the AI analysis the backend was already generating but the frontend was not displaying. Backend tests unblocked.

## 2026-07-28
- **Files changed:**
  - `MaterialControllerTest.java` — Complete rewrite (context load fix, Student principal, csrf, isNull matcher)
  - `FirebaseTokenFilterTest.java` — Added @MockitoSettings(LENIENT), fixed wildcard loop verify count
  - `AuthServiceTest.java` — Fixed exception message assertion
  - `.project-memory/` — CURRENT_STATE, TASKS, SESSION_LOG, NEXT_TASK updated
- **Reason:** Unblock Module 3 controller tests; fix pre-existing test assertion issues
- **Summary:** MaterialControllerTest (0/20 → 20/20). All 85 unit tests now pass. 2 commits pushed to GitHub (468d14d, d70b4a7).
- **Impact:** Full backend test coverage now active (85 unit tests). SecurityConfigTest/AuthControllerTest still require Docker (pre-existing).
